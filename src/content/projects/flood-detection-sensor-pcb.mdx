Custom PCB for a battery-powered flood monitoring system. Integrates thermal imaging, environmental sensors, and LoRa communication for remote deployment in urban areas.

This was my first time designing a PCB. I taught myself KiCad and went from schematic to fabrication-ready Gerbers in a few weeks. Shoutout to [Dr. Elizabeth Carter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liz-carter-853327255/) and Manu Shergill for the mentorship.
