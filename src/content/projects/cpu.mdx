Designed a working 4-bit processor on an FPGA. Built every piece in VHDL: the ALU for math and logic, registers to hold data, a program counter to track instructions, and a state machine to control timing.

Adding two numbers, storing the result, and branching on a condition is pretty basic, but I built the thing that did it. This project helped me realize chip design was something I could see myself pursuing as a career.
