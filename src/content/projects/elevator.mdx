subtitle: "Syracuse University · September 2025"
description: "Programmed an elevator controller from scratch on an ATSAMD21 microcontroller. Users request floors via keypad, and the LCD shows real-time position as the elevator moves. 2-second transitions between floors, LEDs for status, buzzer for arrival.
No Arduino libraries. Everything built at the register level. Timers, interrupts, GPIO, all configured by hand. Tedious but satisfying. Shoutout Sawyer Falkenbush for partnering on this one."
