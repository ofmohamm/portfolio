# Omar Mohammed

I build things that work. This is my corner of the internet.

## What's Here

Portfolio site showcasing hardware projects, embedded systems work, and the occasional FPGA adventure. Built it myself because templates are boring and I wanted to learn Astro.

---

## Stack

- **Astro** — Fast, simple, gets out of the way
- **Plain CSS** — No Tailwind, no frameworks, just vibes
- **Playfair Display + Geist** — Serif headers, clean body text
- **Vercel** — Push to deploy, done

---

## Run It Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ofmohamm/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens at [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321)

## Projects on the Site

**UFONet Sensor Node (CHaRTS)**  
PCB I designed for an IoT flood monitoring system. 2-layer board with Raspberry Pi compute module, LoRaWAN, thermal cameras, GPS. Currently deployed in the field.

**Elevator Control System**  
10-floor controller. ATSAMD21. No Arduino libraries. Just registers and pain (the good kind).

**4-Bit CPU**  
Designed a CPU from scratch in VHDL. Custom instruction set. Runs on an FPGA. Still can't believe it works.

**Bluetooth Messaging**  
Arduino + HC-05. Text your phone from a keypad. Old school Nokia vibes.
