## What's On The Site

**UFONet Sensor Node** — PCB I designed for flood monitoring. LoRaWAN, thermal cameras, GPS. Currently sitting outside in the rain doing its job.

**4-Bit CPU** — Built a CPU from scratch in VHDL. Custom instruction set. Watching it execute instructions I wrote hits different.

**Elevator Controller** — 10-floor system on an ATSAMD21. No Arduino hand-holding. Just me, the datasheet, and registers.

**Bluetooth Messenger** — Text your phone from a keypad. Nokia energy.
